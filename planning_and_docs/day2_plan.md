Day 2 is where your solver stops being a cantilever trick and becomes a usable structural kernel: it can handle member loads (UDL), it can solve a portal frame, and it can output engineering-relevant quantities (reactions, drift, end moments). That’s the bridge to Day 3 (design exploration).

Below is a ruthless, executable Day-2 plan with file-by-file deliverables, integration points, and expectations.

Day 2 objectives

By end of Day 2 you can run:

pytest
py .\demos\run_portal_frame.py


…and you get:

portal frame solves under gravity UDL + lateral point load

printed metrics: max drift, support reactions, max |M|

a simple plot: undeformed vs deformed frame

a UDL validation test that passes (with a meshed beam)

Scope (what’s in / out)
IN (Day 2)

Uniform Distributed Load (UDL) on frame elements (local transverse direction)

Assembly of element equivalent nodal loads into global F

Portal frame demo (2 columns + beam)

Postprocessing: element end forces (N, V, M) in local coordinates

Sanity tests: equilibrium + stability + UDL beam check

OUT (Day 2)

Code-compliant checks (AISC/NDS/etc.)

Fancy diagrams (full moment curve along member)

Rhino/Grasshopper bridge

Optimization / AI surrogate (Day 4)

Architecture rule (how new code interacts with your old code)

You keep these stable:

assemble_global_K(nodes, elements) ✅

solve_linear(K, F, fixed_dofs, ...) ✅

Your Day-1 tests must keep passing unchanged.

You add:

loads.py (new)

post.py (new)

viz.py (optional new)

new demos/tests

Sign conventions (don’t let this bite you)

Global axes: +y up

Downward gravity: Fy = negative

UDL input: define w as force per length in local +y

so for downward load on a horizontal beam: w = -abs(w_down)

Element local DOFs order stays:
[uix, uiy, rzi, ujx, ujy, rzj]

This keeps the math coherent across transform / assembly / post.

Day 2 plan (timeboxed, ruthless)
Block A (1–2 hours): Add element UDL equivalent nodal load
Goal

Given an element length L and UDL w in local +y, produce the 6-vector of consistent nodal loads in local coordinates.

Deliverable

Create: src/mini_branch/loads.py

Functions to implement:

frame2d_equiv_nodal_load_udl(L: float, w: float) -> np.ndarray

assemble_element_loads_global(nodes, elements, element_udls) -> F_global

Definition
Consistent nodal load vector for uniform transverse load w (local +y) is:

Shears: wL/2 at each node

End moments: wL^2/12 with opposite signs

Local equivalent nodal force vector:
[0, wL/2, wL^2/12, 0, wL/2, -wL^2/12]

Then transform to global via the same T you already have:
f_global = T.T @ f_local

Expectation

You can now build F from:

nodal point loads (what you already do)

plus element UDL loads (new)

Block B (2–3 hours): Validate UDL with a meshed simply supported beam
Why meshed?

A single Euler–Bernoulli element won’t match UDL deflection perfectly (UDL produces a quartic curve). Mesh it (e.g., 10 elements) and compare midspan deflection.

Deliverable

Create: tests/test_simply_supported_udl.py

Test case

Beam length L

n = 10 elements, n+1 nodes

Supports: pinned both ends (fix ux, uy at both ends; rotations free)

Apply UDL downward: w = -w0 on each element

Measure midspan node uy_mid

Closed form max deflection:

(sign negative for downward)

Tolerance
Use something like rtol=2e-2 (2%) for n=10. If you want it tighter, bump mesh to n=20.

Expectation

This test is your “I don’t just code, I validate loads” proof.

Block C (2–3 hours): Postprocessing end forces (N/V/M) per element
Goal

Compute element end forces in local coordinates.

Deliverable

Create: src/mini_branch/post.py

Core function
element_end_forces_local(nodes, element, d_global, udl_w=None) -> np.ndarray

Implementation recipe:

compute L,c,s, k_local, T

d_local = T @ d_elem_global

f_local = k_local @ d_local

if element has a UDL: subtract its equivalent nodal load:
f_local = f_local - f_udl_local

return f_local as [Ni, Vi, Mi, Nj, Vj, Mj]

Expectation

For any solved structure you can now print:

max |M| across all members

reactions are already in R

you’re one step away from utilization checks (Day 3/4 optional)

Block D (2–3 hours): Portal frame demo (gravity + lateral)
Deliverable

Create: demos/run_portal_frame.py

Model
Nodes:

0: left base (0,0)

1: left top (0,H)

2: right top (L,H)

3: right base (L,0)

Elements:

left column: (0–1)

beam: (1–2)

right column: (3–2) (or 2–3, consistent)

Supports (keep it simple and stable):

pinned bases: fix (ux, uy) at node 0 and node 3
rotations free

Loads:

Beam UDL downward: w = -w0 in local +y

Lateral point load at node 1 or 2: Fx = +P

Outputs:

drift = max horizontal displacement at top nodes

reactions at supports

element end moments (from post.py)

plot deformed shape (scaled)

Expectation

This demo should run with a single command and produce a plot. This is the “Lucas sees it and immediately gets it” moment.

Block E (1–2 hours): Sanity tests for the portal frame + equilibrium
Deliverables

Create:

tests/test_portal_frame_equilibrium.py

Assertions:

solver does not throw MechanismError

drift finite and nonzero under lateral load

global equilibrium: sum of reactions in x ≈ sum of applied Fx; sum in y ≈ sum of applied Fy (UDL total)

This reinforces “detail-oriented, not vibes-based.”

End-of-Day-2 deliverables checklist

You should have these new files:

src/mini_branch/loads.py

src/mini_branch/post.py

demos/run_portal_frame.py

tests/test_simply_supported_udl.py

tests/test_portal_frame_equilibrium.py

And these outcomes:

pytest all green (Day 1 tests still pass)

portal demo prints drift + max moment + reactions

UDL beam validation passes

How Day 2 sets up Day 3 (directly)

Day 3 is “generate variants + Pareto frontier.” That requires:

A standardized design family (portal frame) ✅ (Day 2 demo becomes the generator template)

A richer load model (UDL + lateral) ✅

A way to compute objective metrics (drift, moments, volume proxy) ✅ (postprocessing unlocks this)

So Day 2 is the last “pure engineering plumbing” day before you go full design/product mode.

Recommended working order (don’t improvise)

Implement loads.py UDL vector + global assembly

Get UDL beam test passing

Implement post.py end forces

Build portal demo using those modules

Add portal equilibrium test

If you follow that order, you’ll finish Day 2 with minimal thrash and maximum “looks professional” output.
